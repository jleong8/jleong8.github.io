The species diversity project was a semester long project done in Biology 265L (Ecology and Evolutionary Biology). This project was conducted on the Wa'ahila Ridge across 11 survey plots. Each survey plot helped gather information on rainfall, sunlight, species richness, and soil depth. A null hypothesis was developed for this experiment and using the data gathered I would try and prove my null hypothesis wrong and in favor of an alternative hypothesis. The two null hypotheses I had were "Rainfall does not affect species diversity" and "Sunlight does not affect species diversity". 

After 52 days, data was sucessfully gathered and could now be used to analyze and check my hypotheses. It was found that my null hypotheses was indeed false. Data showed that areas that lacked sunlight and rainfall showed a drop in species diversity. This result was unsurprising as much like all living things we all need basic neccessities such as water survive and prosper. The data only furthur proved this point and should this experiment be done again it may have been better to gather data for the longer duration of time in order to help increase accuracy within my data.

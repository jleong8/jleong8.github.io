<img class="ui top aligned medium image" src="../images/stickerbook.jpg">

In this project, I created a program that had four images that would act as a sticker. These four images could be duplicated and pasted
anywhere on the screen where it would stay there similar to how a real life sticker book would function. Upon pasting, the "sticker" would
play a sound as well. Each sticker could be replicated anywhere in the background and after the user is satisfied they can save it. Once
the user returns to the program they would be able to load a previous version they had created. If the user is unsatisfied with what they
had a created then they could simply clear the screen. This program was created to practice java and its different functions.

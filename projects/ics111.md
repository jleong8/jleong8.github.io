summary: My team studied created a program that would take in a picture and transform it into a circle where it would ultimatly revil the picture in the end after multiple splits of the circle.

This was a final project created for ICS 111. In this project me and my group members created a program which would take a picture and transform it into a single circle. But, upon user interaction with the cursor, the circle would split and would continue splitting depending on where the cursor was. The picture should slowly form and become visible once the circles become small enough. This project was to demonstrate our understanding of java by creating our classes, methods, and overall knowledge of java syntax. I think following the completion of this project me and my group was able to properly demonstrate this and we were all satisfied with the final product.

There were many obstacles to this project. One obstacle was that the circles were not splitting into small enough circles so that the image would become noticeable. Another was the split time, as more and more circles were created, the program would run slowler and slower. From this experience, I learned that the way the code was being implemented to store data was causing a slow running time. Either the way we were handling the data needed to be entirely rewritten or we needed to revise it. But, in the end, my group was able to successfully overcome these obstacles and create it into what is today. This project was created to demonstrate our ability to code in java and show what we have learned in our ICS class.

## Configuration Management

Configuration management can be a very advantageous skill to have especially when it comes to working with large sets of files 
and having to maintain them with other people. I think configuration management may be one of the biggest advances made for 
software engineering because code now becomes more portable and accessible to different people. People can now write and test their
own code without having to worry about breaking other people's code. Often times when people want to test their own code without 
touching any of the main code this is known as branching. Branching is a feature that allows seperate code to be written and in the 
end the code can be merged with the main code when they deem its ready. Being able to track changes and modify it to where it best fits
helps in collaborative work where things can often times get mixed up. I think at its current state, git and github work very well together
because anyone from anywhere can have access to it as long as they have an internet connection. I can see why git is the most popular
technology for configuration management. It provides so much more opportunities for people to work with others and contains a lot of 
features helps carry out tasks in a much more effective manner.

I have never had any issues with lack of configuration management but I do see how it can be a good skill to develop. Lack of configuration
management could potentially lead to wasted time due to duplicate code or lead to broken code. Good configuration management helps teams 
track each other's progress and push need features of a program in a much more timely manner. When it comes to working as a team in a company, it can be expensive to be paying multiple developers to work on a project. Therefore, cutting costs with proper configuration 
management can help not only your team look good but the company could potentially be thankful for it as well.

## Github or Git?

I think that github would not be in the position it is today had there not been git. Github is a service that provides hosting for
git repositories so it does nothing more than store projects and provide features of git. But, most people come to the website
for the functionality itself which is git. Git provides much of what makes up github today. Git allows for peers to contribute 
amongst each other's projects. Github is a website that is easily replaceable because it is just hosting a popular feature 
that everyone is looking to use. Although I don't think github is leaving anytime soon, I do see that Git is a big contributor to the 
traffic github does recieve.

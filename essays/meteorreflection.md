## Initial Thoughts

Having just finished learning HTML and CSS, meteor was a massive step up in both of the difficulty of it and its rather steep learning curve.
One of the initial steps involved in meteor was loading the application template into the project folder and loading it onto intelliji. I
was surprised by the large amount of files and was left confused as to what the contents of all these files were. I found it incredibly helpful
that there were screencasts available to guide me through everything because I can truthfully say I would not have been able to learn it 
on my own or learn it as effectively. As I became more familiar with the meteor platform, I was surprised by the depth and wide range of 
functionality it provided for web development. Each file served a purpose that built upon one another in order to create the final product
which was the website. I think in my free time I would definetely want to learn more on meteor in order to continue exploring what I can 
do with it and hopefully be able to create a product out of it. As my proficiency in meteor continues I hope to also be able to apply that 
knowledge into the final project and create something that can be displayed outside of class. 

## Love & Frustrations

Although meteor is a very good development platform, I learned very quickly that it is also not very forgiving towards people who make 
mistakes. There had been countless times when I had either had an extra line or a missing semicolon and the terminal would not run
the localhost server. Although this happens with any programming language it is still something that can be frustrating. But, one thing
I liked is that it does return feedback messages when something goes wrong and it directs you to where the error could be. This helped me 
save a lot of time unlike in programs like C where sometimes it would compile even if something was wrong. Another frustration that I
encountered was how I had to make sure to import my js and html files or else they wouldn't show up in localhost. At one point during a 
practice WOD, I had done everything correctly but nothing was showing up. This was until I discovered that I needed to import the files
in order to provide any results. For a begineer, meteor can be incredibly frustrating and to this day I think I still have a lot to learn
about meteor. There is a a lot going on and it can be incredibly overwhelming but I think with practice things will start becoming more 
familiar.

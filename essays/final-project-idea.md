# Overview

*The problem*: Studnets can be forgetful and need some sort of application to help remind them of their responsibilities

*The solution*: Created a web-based calender when students can input any important tasks that they may need reminders on

It can be often difficult to stay organized when there is so much going on in school especially for students. On average, students are 
recommended to take 15 credits a semester which can be equivalent to 4-5 classes. Having so many classes, it can be difficult to 
stay organized with all the homework and projects that are given throughout the semester. We need a solution to this problem that and that
solution is to create a web based calender that can provide daily reminders of what is going on in their life. The conventional way 
of keeping organized would be to have a planner but this can a hassle because you could potentially forget it and it can be heavy. But, 
people especially students are always on their phone. Having a web based calender would help students easily access the reminders they need.
In this web-based calender, we could include campus events, club events, and any class based due dates.  

Important design goals for The Planner are:

- To encourage students to stay organized
- Promote campus hosted events
- To spread word of all available clubs on campus
- Import important school deadlines(ex. fafsa, class registration, parking pass, library book due dates)

# Mockup page ideas

- UH login page
- Settings page
- Calender page
- Add/Delete/Modify tasks
- Club page section
- UH events section

# Use case ideas

- UH login, gets to personal homepage, show calender
- User adds tasks, modify tasks, remove tasks
- User goes to settings, filter all club/school events
- User goes to tasks, checks off completed tasks


# Beyond the basics

- Phone popup for reminder
- Sync teacher inputted due dates with student calenders
- Video notification for school events

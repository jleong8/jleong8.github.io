## What ethics means to me

<p> Ethical means to follow a certain set of beliefs in which you not only follow but also act upon to preserve right and wrong morals. 
Ethics can be a difficult subject of matter because it can vary depending on how someone was brought up in the world. It can also vary 
depending on an individual’s religion, beliefs, and values. Having these vast variations, I think it makes it difficult to measure how 
ethical someone’s motives and actions are. But, I think ethics can be generalized upon individuals by requiring that it must follow 
natural laws that every human being is given such as the right to life, liberty, property, and pursuit of happiness. Generally, most 
ethical beliefs and actions can also be agreed upon by the clear majority of people. Although, the definition of ethics can vary it 
should generally be described as the belief of following right and wrong values that majority of people can come to an agreement upon.

## Ethics in Software Engineering

<p> In terms of software engineering, I believe that it means to write and develop code which does not bring harm to others, benefit the 
community, and not infringe on anyone else’s work without consent. As a student, a lot of the code I currently has not direct impact to 
society but for developers that make code that have life applications it is extremely important to publish code that has no harmful 
intent. Software engineers should develop with the intent of benefitting others which could often mean turning down money or resigning a 
job to avoid doing some unethical task. In addition, software engineers should also give credit to others if they received any type of 
help in their code. This is common practice not only in the coding world but also in the science community in general. By giving credit 
it helps highlight those who put hard work into their research and splits the recognition amongst everyone rather than a single individual.

## My Concluding Thoughts

<p> Unfortunately, Bill was presented with a situation in which he developed a website for a drug in which led to a death of a girl. But, had 
he been more experienced and aware of the ethical approaches to take the situation could have been avoided. Ethics is incredibly important 
in helping make good decisions. To have ethical values means to think and conduct tasks with good intentions and not let other sources get 
in the way of making those decisions. To be ethical also means to avoid harming others who are undeserving of it. This could either be 
through the code you write, the actions you take, or not giving credit to others. Ethics is what helps drive us in the decisions we make and
we should strive to learn how to approach situations in which ethics comes into play.

Example of website created using Semantic UI

## Why Semantic UI?

  Coming into Semantic UI, I had no prior experience of what UI frameworks can bring to the table. I was incredibly surprised by how useful
it was and the aesthetic look of it. I had previously tried a couple examples of using only html with no frameworks and it looked incredibly ancient. The layout of the page was bland and it was not something I would want to present to others. This made me wonder what I could do to improve it and that was when I learned of Semantic UI. There are so many functions available for Semantic UI that allows for 
manipulation of the site layout and it is simple to do as well. By visting the Semantic UI documentation, one can simply copy and paste
code into their html file saving a lot of time of having to figure out what to do with it. A lot of the class names are also named so that
its functionality is easily recognizable. For example "three wide column" provides a column that is a length of three wide. A lot of the 
times I didn't need to look back at the documentation because I could easily try out different variations within the name to modify it to
my need. Having the frameworks, it also saved a lot of time because rewriting new source code for a site can be incredibly time consuming.
Frameworks like Semantic UI are prebuilt so instead of wasting my own time I can use something that was created for the purpose of not having to write reptitious code allowing for quick reproduction of other websites.

## Framework Issues
 
 Although the benefits vastly outweight the negatives of using an UI framework. There are still somethings that need to be addressed
 when it comes to using a UI framework. While using a framework is great, I think it is also useful to know how to create your own
 framework. Since I have only begun learning html and its framework these past two weeks it doesn't bother me too much that I haven't
 learned how to create a framework yet but furthur down the line I would like to learn how. As a begineer having frameworks is useful but
 I think in order to stand out and create better websites I think its important to learn how to develop my own. It is also restricitng 
 to have a framework because everything is predesigned so if I wanted to be a little more imaginative with my website it would be difficult 
 to do. For example, I currently follow a format of having a header, a center column section, and a footer. Although there is nothing 
 wrong with this, it seems like every other site looks somewhat similar. That is why I think it is important to either learn more frameworks or to start creating my own so that it creates a sense of uniqueness.

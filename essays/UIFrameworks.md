##Why Semantic UI?

  Coming into Semantic UI, I had no prior experience of what UI frameworks can bring to the table. I was incredibly surprised by how useful
it was and the aesthetic look of it. I had previously tried a couple examples of using only html with no frameworks and it looked incredibly
ancient. The layout of the page was bland and it was not something I would want to present to others. This made me wonder what I could do
to improve it and that was when I learned of Semantic UI. There are so many functions available for Semantic UI that allows for 
manipulation of the site layout and it is simple to do as well. By visting the Semantic UI documentation, one can simply copy and paste
code into their html file saving a lot of time of having to figure out what to do with it. A lot of the class names are also named so that
its functionality is easily recognizable. For example "three wide column" provides a column that is a length of three wide. A lot of the 
times I didn't need to look back at the documentation because I could easily try out different variations within the name to modify it to
my need. Having the frameworks, it also saved a lot of time because rewriting new source code for a site can be incredibly time consuming.
Frameworks like Semantic UI are prebuilt so instead of wasting my own time I can use something that was created for the purpose of not having
to write reptitious code allowing for quick reproduction of other websites.

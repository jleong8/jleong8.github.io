##Introduction 
Having questions especially when it comes to programming is very common thing. Sometimes it can be simple fixes like missing semicolon or 
it can be more complex ones which require more analysis of the code itself. Nevertheless, it can be frustrating when these issues appear andit can be beneficial to have a second opinion from someone else. A common step people such as myself would take it is to turn towards google.Google is very helpful in offering help to similar questions from various websites such as StackOverFlow. But, when seeking for help from websites such as these it is important to know how to ask your question the smart way so that users will be more inclined to help you.

##Why smart questions?
Smart questions require a bit of an effort and there are many factors that need to be addressed before a question can be considered smart.
A smart question is one that shows the users understanding of the issue and shows his/her attempt at the problem whether it be by themselves or through searching for other similar questions on other forums. A simple copy and paste of the homework problem will not be sufficient and is often frowned upon. Smart questions are very important and crucial to the learning process of oneself. Smart questions will require an individual to learn and to research before simply turning to someone else help. A smart question challenges the person to break the problemdown and analyze it in a way that would be more friendly for someone else to look at. Having long lines of code will show someone that there has been no attempt at the problem and shows that the asker simply wants someone else to do it for them. Smart questions build smart coders. Being a sponge is not enough, it is too passive and it doesn't take enough effort. A more active role is neccessary in being successful at coding and through asking smart questions and being a part of the process is what is most beneficial.

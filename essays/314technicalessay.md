#The beginning

I think like many people who get into computer science and software engineering their interest stemmed from a memorable experience(s) when they were young.
For me, these graet memories began when I got my first computer when I was in third grade. There was so much that could be done on the computer and it amazed me as I continued to discover all these great websites and video games as I grew up. These great memories is what led me into choosing to major in computer science today. Technology has exponentially improved within this past decade and it never ceases to amaze me how we have come so far and to build the things with such incredible functionality. Seeing all these great accomplishments being made I don't want to be the one of the sideline, I want to be a part of these accomplishments and that is what drives me to continue pursuing software engineer and computer science in general.

#My interests

As of right now my two current interests are in science and in computer science. Hence, I am currently majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Biology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I am currently a senior and I think after taking so many courses, I have discovered what I like to study. In regards to computer science and software engineering, I enjoy learning the many different languages that are available to us and each one serves a purpose to different things. I am currently learning Java, C, C++, and Javascript and I hope that I will be able to translate that into good use in future projects. 

##The future

Being that I have a background in science and currently building experience in software engineering I hope that one day I will be able to tie the two together. I know that a lot of data gathered from science can benefit from software engineer greatly. Being able to visualize data and process it can help in drawing results and conclusions much simplier. I think its neccessary to implement the use the vast of amount of technology available to us as we can greatly benefit from it. I hope to make that happen and hopefully future projects that I work on I will be able to demonstrate a strong ability in software engineering and put my science background into use as well.

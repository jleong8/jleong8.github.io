a part of these accomplishments and that is what drives me to continue pursuing software engineer and computer science in general.

#My interests

As of right now my two current interests are in science and in computer science. Hence, I am currently majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Biology 
at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I am currently a senior and I think I

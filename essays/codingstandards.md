## Coding Standard is essential

  Coding Standards seems like an obvious and practical form of practice when it comes to software development because of how essential it 
is to readiblilty of the code. But, this is often not the case and people especially students like myself are more focused on writing the 
code itself rather than improving how our code looks. The importance of coding standard can be attributed to languages such as English. In
english we are taught how to write with proper grammer and to write from left to right. People are reading writing from right to left but itis not easily as readable and makes it difficult for others to read. Coding standards are very much similar, the idea is to develop code
that is good quality that can be shared amongst others. We should also be able to run our programs through tools and are designed specificallyfor issues such as these. We need to make good use of what we have before us and it can vastly improves our code and it helps that it doesn't require much time to conduct. Of course, it is also the responsibility of the coder themselves to conduct a formal review of that errors that are spotted and fix them. Running the tool is only half of it, fixing the errors is what will be the most important part to practicing proper coding standard within your software.

## Eslint

  Prior to this week, I had no experience with any tools for coding standards. Eslint turned out to be incredibly helpful and I found
that it helped me become more aware of potential syntax errors. During the time I was writing my code, I tried to thourougly think
through my code in order to avoid EsLint. I think this would help me in the long run because it would help develop good habits of writing
software that is more complient with coding standards. During the times that I was running into Eslint errors it helped me realize my
mistakes and I would make a mental note of not doing that error again. As a student, Eslint not only spots errors but teaches me
how to be a better software writer. I want to be able to build a strong foundation within my writing so that if someone were to read my 
code they would be able to read it with ease.

is to readiblilty of the code. But, this is often not the case and people especially students like myself are more focused on writing the 
code itself rather than improving how our code looks. The importance of coding standard can be attributed to languages such as English. In
english we are taught how to write with proper grammer and to write from left to right. People are reading writing from right to left but it
is not easily as readable and makes it difficult for others to read. Coding standards are very much similar, the idea is to develop code
that is good quality that can be shared amongst others. We should also be able to run our programs through tools and are designed specifically
for issues such as these. We need to make good use of what we have before us and it can vastly improves our code and it helps that it 
doesn't require much time to conduct. Of course, it is also the responsibility of the coder themselves to conduct a formal review of 
that errors that are spotted and fix them. Running the tool is only half of it, fixing the errors is what will be the most important part to
practicing proper coding standard within your software.

that it helped me become more aware of possible

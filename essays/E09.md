## What do you think about Javascript so far?

I think Javascript is somewhat familiar because a lot of the coding syntax is similar but there are slight variations. Although it is fairly similar it can be difficult to translate what I know from Java into Javascript especially under timed conditions such as the WODS. I think I need to continue working on improving my Javascript and especially being that its my 2nd coding language it can be overwhelming since I've only been to exposed to one language so far.

## WODS

I find the WODS to be something new to me and it can be stressful to be coding under timed conditions. The practice WODS were a good introduction to WODS as it gave me an idea of what the actual WOD would be like and it also exposed me to different types of questions to somewhat prepare me. I think once I get used to the WODS it can be helpful because it could potentially help me think quicker which can be advantageous in the work environment.
